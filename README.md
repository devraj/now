# Now

I've followed [Derek Sivers](https://sive.rs/) for a while and am fancinated by his work, musings and ability to tell stories. If you don't know who Derek is then I recommend you:
- Watch these two TED talks [Keep your goals to yourself ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHopJHSlVo4) and [How to start a movement](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V74AxCqOTvg)
- read [Anything You Want](https://sive.rs/a)
- Visit his [website](https://sive.rs/)

A feature of his website that I find rather interesting is a page he maintains called [Now](https://sive.rs/now) where he roughly maintains the following information 

- "Quote"
- Location
- Professional title
- What do you do?
- Why?
- What should we read?
- URLs

on what he's up to these days. Over the years others have adopted the idea and there's now a collection of Now pages at [NowNowNow.com](https://nownownow.com/). You can also follow their [Twitter](https://twitter.com/NowNowNow) feed.

While building the new Anomaly website I thought it would be a good idea to add one for the business to tell people what we are working on these days. While reading about Now I realised that Derek intends Now pages to be for individuals. The crux of the idea is that it's your snapshot!

I had a spark where I thought, hey this ought to be something like an `RSS` feed. I [reached out](https://twitter.com/mdevraj/status/1452133798745817092?s=20) to Derek on Twitter asking him:

> .@sivers is there a syndication protocol for @NowNowNow?

to which he replied

> Not yet, but I'd love to hear what you'd like from it. Email me? https://sive.rs/contact

To be respectful of his time, I decided to put propose (or the germ there of) a standard before I emailed him. This repository contains the [RFC](RFC.md) and some samples.

My ideas are heavily inspired by Apple's approach to Podcast feeds:

- [Podcast RSS feed requirements](https://podcasters.apple.com/support/823-podcast-requirements)
